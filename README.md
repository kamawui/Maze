# Maze

Distributed Lab test task. 
A program which randomly generates maze with treasures and traps.


## Description

Maze is a 2d matrix with such types of cells:
- Entrance — only one and must be on some outer side of the maze.
- Exit — only one and must be on some outer side of the maze.
- Road — a cell that the player can pass through.
- Wall — a cell that the player can not pass through.
- Trap — a cell that the player can pass through, but passing 3 such cells will kill the player. 0-5 cells on level.
- Treasure — just a cell with some treasure. 0-1 cells on level.

---

Road and Wall cells of the maze are generated by **Eller’s algorithm.**

Traps and Treasure locactions are chosen with **Lee's algorithm.** 

---

Additional rules:

- Treasure and traps are generated when square area (length * width) of a maze is bigger than 15 and 20 respectively.
- Treasure is always placed at the most distant cell from entrance.
- There are no traps on the ways to entrance or treasure.

## Technologies
- **Language:** C++17  
- **Build system:** GNU Make on Ubuntu (Linux)  

## How to run
1. Clone the project to a folder on your device:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamawui/Maze.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd Maze
   ```
   
3. Compile the program:
   
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./maze
   ```

## Usage
To generate maze enter its length>1 and width>1 which are asked by program: 
```bash
Enter maze length: <length>
Enter maze width: <width>
```

## Output
After setting length and width you will see a maze. Start/exit cells of the maze are always on the top/bottom row respectively. 

Every special cell has its own mark or color:
- Entrance (start) is marked with letter **S**.
- Exit (finish) is marked with letter **F** and green color.
- Treasure is marked with letter **T** and yellow color.
- Traps are marked with red color.

## Example
<img width="811" height="806" alt="{4711C2B6-CA23-42B2-8A55-7F517C04DA10}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55748c83-d847-4298-8d63-79a5763addc6" />



## Efficiency and complexity
1. Generating maze (**Eller’s algorithm**) — O(width * length).
2. Finding distances (**Lee's algorithm**) — O(width * length).
3. Placing treasure (finding the most distant cell) — O(width * length).
4. Placing traps — O(width * length).
5. Printing maze — O(width * length).

In total:
**O(width * length)**

## Time to implement the task
Around 12 hours.
